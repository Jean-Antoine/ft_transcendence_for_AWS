BACKEND :
1/ Modify views.py method : Games should not have POST requests as 
players should not be able to manually create new games. Create def create_game(player1, player2) 
function to trigger game creation when game is being created

2/ Be able to play on the same keyboard
2b/ Each player enter their username and then take turns playing against each other

3/ email validation before saving in profile_view ? 

4/ sanitize ? 
from django.shortcuts import render
from django.utils.html import escape

def comment_view(request):
    if request.method == "POST":
        user_comment = request.POST.get("comment")
        safe_comment = escape(user_comment)  # Escapes dangerous characters
        # Store or display safe_comment

Ok to sum it up, all I have to do right now to design the backend of my website is : 
 - Create views of everything in views.py
 - Make correspondance of the views and urls in urls.py

is that it or did i miss anything ?

Yes, you’ve got the core steps right, but let’s refine it a little to ensure you cover everything needed for a functional Django backend. Here's the complete breakdown of the tasks:

1. Create Views in views.py
For each page or endpoint you want to serve, create a view in views.py. Views handle the logic behind the pages, such as interacting with the database, processing forms, or returning templates.
You can use Django’s built-in views (e.g., for login, logout, etc.) or create your custom views.

2. Define URL Patterns in urls.py
In urls.py, create URL patterns that correspond to the views you defined in views.py.
You need to map URLs to views so that when users visit a certain URL, the appropriate view will be executed.

3. Create Templates (Optional, but Common)
If your views need to render HTML pages (for example, the homepage, or a registration form), you'll need templates. These templates should be placed in the appropriate directory (usually templates/).
You can pass dynamic data to the template from your views using context.

4. Set Up Static Files (Optional, for CSS, JavaScript, Images)
If your website uses static files like CSS, JavaScript, or images, make sure you define a static directory.
You’ll also need to configure Django to serve static files during development.

5. Handle Forms and Validations (If Needed)
If you are working with forms (e.g., user registration, login), use Django’s built-in form handling, validation, and models.
You can create custom forms using forms.py or use model forms for easier handling of data.

6. Configure Authentication and Permissions (If Needed)
If you need user login, registration, and authentication, Django provides views and models for user management.
Make sure you have URLs and views for login, logout, registration, and possibly password management.
Set up permissions or decorators (e.g., @login_required) to restrict access to certain views based on user status.

7. Test the Views and URLs
After setting up the views, URLs, and templates, run the Django server and test if everything works by visiting the URLs you've set up.
You might also want to write unit tests to ensure everything is functioning as expected.

8. Database Setup (If Needed)
If you're storing data in a database (e.g., user profiles, tournament data), define models in models.py and apply migrations using python manage.py migrate.
Use the Django ORM to interact with the database (e.g., querying for tournament data in your home view).


So to summarize, yes:

Views in views.py define the logic.
URLs in urls.py map the URLs to your views.
Templates are used to render HTML pages, and static files are used for assets like CSS and JavaScript.
Forms and authentication are additional features to manage user input and authentication.

-------------------------------- SPA WORKFLOW ----------------------------

 1. Frontend (script.js)

    Event Binding and Login Form Submission:
    When the DOM is fully loaded (DOMContentLoaded event), you render the login view using renderLoginView.
    When the user submits the login form, you intercept the default behavior with event.preventDefault() and send an asynchronous POST request using fetch to the endpoint /auth/login/.
    ✅ This is correct.

    Cookie Handling:
    The getCookie function retrieves a cookie value, likely for CSRF tokens. This ensures the fetch request includes proper security headers.
    ✅ This is good practice.

2. Django URL Configuration (urls.py)

    The endpoint /auth/login/ is correctly routed to the login_view function in your views.
    ✅ This is correct.

3. Backend (views.py)

    Login Authentication Flow:
        Extract username and password from the request.data (assuming JSON data is sent).
        Use authenticate() to check the user's credentials against Django’s authentication system.
        If authentication succeeds:
            Generate a 2FA code using a generate_2fa_code() function.
            Store the 2FA code, the user ID, and the code's expiry time in the session.
            Send the 2FA code to the user's email using send_mail.

    ✅ This flow is correct.

    Session Storage: The 2FA code, user ID, and expiry time are stored in the session (request.session). The session mechanism is secure if used over HTTPS and with proper settings (e.g., SESSION_COOKIE_SECURE, SESSION_ENGINE).
    ✅ This is standard practice.

    Response to the Frontend: If the email is successfully sent, the response returns a success message (2FA code sent) with a 200 status. If there’s an error (e.g., in send_mail), it returns an error message and a 500 status. If authentication fails, it returns a 401 error.
    ✅ This aligns with REST principles.

Flow Summary

    The frontend (script.js) sends a POST request to /auth/login/ with the username and password from the login form.
    The Django REST API:
        Validates the credentials using authenticate().
        Generates a 2FA code if authentication is successful.
        Stores the 2FA code, user ID, and expiry time in the session.
        Sends the 2FA code to the user's email.
        Responds with a JSON object indicating success or failure.

✅ Your understanding of the flow is correct!
Additional Tips

    Error Handling in the Frontend:
    In your fetch call, ensure you handle all possible responses (e.g., 401 for invalid credentials, 500 for server errors).

    Debugging in Development:
    Log session data (request.session) in the backend to confirm it’s being stored as expected. Example:

    print(request.session.items())

    Testing Email Sending:
    If testing locally, use Django’s EMAIL_BACKEND = 'django.core.mail.backends.console.EmailBackend' to print emails to the console instead of sending them.

By following this approach, you’re building a robust SPA with RESTful backend integration. 🎉
