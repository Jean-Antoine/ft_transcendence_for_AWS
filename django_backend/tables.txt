Ok to sum it up, all I have to do right now to design the backend of my website is : 
 - Create views of everything in views.py
 - Make correspondance of the views and urls in urls.py

is that it or did i miss anything ?

Yes, you’ve got the core steps right, but let’s refine it a little to ensure you cover everything needed for a functional Django backend. Here's the complete breakdown of the tasks:

1. Create Views in views.py
For each page or endpoint you want to serve, create a view in views.py. Views handle the logic behind the pages, such as interacting with the database, processing forms, or returning templates.
You can use Django’s built-in views (e.g., for login, logout, etc.) or create your custom views.

2. Define URL Patterns in urls.py
In urls.py, create URL patterns that correspond to the views you defined in views.py.
You need to map URLs to views so that when users visit a certain URL, the appropriate view will be executed.

3. Create Templates (Optional, but Common)
If your views need to render HTML pages (for example, the homepage, or a registration form), you'll need templates. These templates should be placed in the appropriate directory (usually templates/).
You can pass dynamic data to the template from your views using context.

4. Set Up Static Files (Optional, for CSS, JavaScript, Images)
If your website uses static files like CSS, JavaScript, or images, make sure you define a static directory.
You’ll also need to configure Django to serve static files during development.

5. Handle Forms and Validations (If Needed)
If you are working with forms (e.g., user registration, login), use Django’s built-in form handling, validation, and models.
You can create custom forms using forms.py or use model forms for easier handling of data.

6. Configure Authentication and Permissions (If Needed)
If you need user login, registration, and authentication, Django provides views and models for user management.
Make sure you have URLs and views for login, logout, registration, and possibly password management.
Set up permissions or decorators (e.g., @login_required) to restrict access to certain views based on user status.

7. Test the Views and URLs
After setting up the views, URLs, and templates, run the Django server and test if everything works by visiting the URLs you've set up.
You might also want to write unit tests to ensure everything is functioning as expected.

8. Database Setup (If Needed)
If you're storing data in a database (e.g., user profiles, tournament data), define models in models.py and apply migrations using python manage.py migrate.
Use the Django ORM to interact with the database (e.g., querying for tournament data in your home view).


So to summarize, yes:

Views in views.py define the logic.
URLs in urls.py map the URLs to your views.
Templates are used to render HTML pages, and static files are used for assets like CSS and JavaScript.
Forms and authentication are additional features to manage user input and authentication.
If you have any questions or need help setting up something specific, feel free to ask!
